As someone with limited bandwidth, I want to be able to look up images without ads bogging down my internet speeds

As an indecisive person, I want the results of my searches to be limited to the most relevant images

As someone on mobile, I want the website format to change to best fit my screen

As someone with deadlines, I would like to find the images I want with less time wasted
